    "# 🚀 Project Recap: Clinical Trial Termination Risk Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Objective**\n",
    "**Goal:** Predict the probability of a clinical trial being **Terminated** (Failure) vs. **Completed** (Success) based *strictly* on data available at the start of the trial.\n",
    "**Business Value:** Early identification of high-risk trials to optimize portfolio management for Pharma/Investors.\n",
    "**Constraint:** 8-Day Sprint (MVP focus).\n",

    "---\n",

    "### **2. The Target Variable**\n",
    "*   **Source:** `studies.txt` $\\to$ Column `overall_status`.\n",
    "*   **Logic:**\n",
    "    *   **0 (Success):** `COMPLETED`\n",
    "    *   **1 (Failure):** `TERMINATED`, `WITHDRAWN`, `SUSPENDED`\n",
    "*   **Filters:**\n",
    "    *   `study_type` = 'Interventional'\n",
    "    *   `intervention_type` = 'Drug' or 'Biological'\n",
    "    *   `start_year`: 2000 to 2015 (Core Cohort).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **A. Operational & Sponsor Risk (Financial/Execution)**\n",
    "| Feature Name | Source | Logic | Why? |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`sponsor_tier`** | `sponsors.txt` | **Static Mapping:** Matched against a hardcoded list of Top 20 Pharma (Pfizer, GSK, etc.).<br>• Tier 1: Giants<br>• Tier 2: Others | **Leakage Fix:** We removed dynamic counting to prevent future information from leaking into the training set. |\n",
    "| **`sponsor_clean`** | `sponsors.txt` | Regex cleaning (remove \"Inc\", \"LLC\"). | Used for **Target Encoding** to capture specific sponsor performance history. |\n",
    "| **`is_international`** | `countries.txt` | Binary (1 if >1 country). | Multi-country trials are operationally harder but suggest higher investment. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Scientific & Protocol Risk (Complexity)**\n",
    "| Feature Name | Source | Logic | Why? |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`phase_ordinal`** | `studies.txt` | **Integer Mapping:**<br>• Phase 1 $\\to$ 1<br>• Phase 1/2 & Phase 2 $\\to$ 2<br>• Phase 2/3 & Phase 3 $\\to$ 3 | **Risk Bucketing:** Mixed phases (1/2) are treated as the higher risk/efficacy hurdle (2). |\n",
    "| **`num_primary_endpoints`** | `calculated_values.txt` | Raw Count. | More endpoints = higher chance of missing one = higher failure risk. |\n",
    "| **`criteria_len_log`** | `eligibilities.txt` | `Log(Length of text)`. | Longer criteria = stricter protocol = harder recruitment. |\n",
    "| **`healthy_volunteers`** | `eligibilities.txt` | Binary. | Phase 1 often allows healthy volunteers (lower scientific risk). |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Market Context (Competition)**\n",
    "| Feature Name | Source | Logic | Why? |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`competition_broad`** | Derived | Count of trials in same `therapeutic_area` in year $Y$ and $Y-1$. | **Leakage Fix:** We stopped looking at $Y+1$. Measures market saturation at launch. |\n",

    "#### **D. Text Features (NLP Readiness)**\n",
    "| Feature Name | Source | Logic | Why? |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`txt_tags`** | Mixed | Concatenation of `official_title` + `keywords` + `intervention_name`. | Raw text for future TF-IDF or Embedding layers. |\n",

    "### **4. Data Processing Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: The Loader (`data_loader_temp.py`)**\n",
    "*   **Robust Parsing:** Uses a dual-strategy (`csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL` vs `quoting=3`) to handle broken pipe-delimiters in the raw AACT text files.\n",
    "*   **Filtering:** Aggressively filters for \"Drugs/Biologics\" using `interventions.txt` IDs.\n",
    "*   **Leakage Control:** Calculates competition metrics using *only* past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: The Pipeline (`preprocessing_temp.py`)**\n",
    "*   **Model:** Transitioning from Logistic Regression to **XGBoost**.\n",
    "*   **Scaling:**\n",
    "    *   `MinMaxScaler`: Applied to `phase_ordinal` (preserves order).\n",
    "    *   `StandardScaler`: Applied to Years/Counts (optional for XGBoost, but kept for stability).\n",
    "*   **Encoding:**\n",
    "    *   `OneHotEncoder`: For low cardinality (Gender, Agency Class).\n",
    "    *   `TargetEncoder`: For high cardinality (`sponsor_clean`, `pathology`). **Crucial:** This learns the \"Success Rate\" of specific diseases/sponsors from the Training set only.\n"
