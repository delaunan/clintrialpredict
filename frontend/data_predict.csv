Common standard of care regimens use either a proteasome inhibitor (PI) or an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) in combination with dexamethasone with or without a monoclonal antibody (mAb) such as daratumumab. After relapse from PIs or IMiDs, patients are often retreated with drugs that have same mechanism of action to which they have been sensitive. The disease becomes refractory and all effective treatment options are exhausted. Daratumumab is a human IgG1 mAb that binds with high affinity to unique epitope on cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) and attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38. Study is to determine the efficacy of Dara-SC in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) in adult participants with relapsed refractory MM who had 1 to 3 prior line(s) of treatment including a line containing daratumumab to evaluate daratumumab retreatment. The MM treatment is determined on an individual basis where patient's age, prior therapy, bone marrow function, co-morbidities, patient preference and time to relapse are considered. Common standard of care regimens use either PI or an IMiD in combination with dexamethasone with or without a mAb. It is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: Screening (28 days), Treatment, and Follow-Up.

Part A will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TF0023 spray in a higher dose . Efficacy will be assessed by the change in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score from baseline to Week 16. At Week 16, a blinded interim analysis will be performed to determine if TF0023 shows positive results with a higher proportion of patients in the TF0023 group showing a more favorable outcome compared with the placebo group. If the results are positive, then Part B will be initiated to further evaluate safety and efficacy of TF0023 spray as well as to determine the best dosing regimen for the signs and symptoms and functional improvement of patients with ischemic strokes.~Part A In Part A , approximately 200 patients who are stable per the NIHSS will be screened as early as 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and approximately 75 will be randomized to active or placebo treatment in a 2:1 ratio (TF0023 \[50 patients\] and placebo \[25 patients\]).~Each patient enrolled in Group A will receive study treatment in a double-blind manner for 16 weeks starting between 3 and 60 days after the onset of stroke symptoms (Day 1 of the study). Qualified study personnel will instruct the patients and/or caregivers how to apply the study treatment accurately so that patients or caregivers will administer high dose of either TF0023 or placebo twice daily (approximately every 12 hours).~Patients will return to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 for efficacy and safety assessments. After the Week 16 assessments have been performed, patients will receive active treatment in an open-label manner starting the next day through the end of the study (EOS) at Week 32. Patients will return to the study site at Week 24 and Week 32 (EOS) for efficacy and safety assessments. An Early Termination visit will occur if the patient is discontinued from the study prematurely. Patients will have a follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the Early Termination visit or the Week 32 (EOS) visit.~An interim analysis will be performed using the data collected through the study up to and including the Week 16 visit. If the analysis of the mRS shows that treatment with TF0023 is positive compared with placebo (mRS score of 0 to 2 indicates functional independence), Part B will start to enroll patients. If the analysis shows that treatment with TF0023 is not positive compared with placebo (mRS score \>2), Part B will not enroll any patients.~Part B In Part B, approximately 400 patients who are stable per the NIHSS will be screened as early as 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and approximately 150 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Group B (middle dose of TF0023 or placebo twice daily) or Group C (low dose of TF0023 or placebo twice daily ). Patients will be further randomized in a 2:1 ratio within each treatment group: Group B - TF0023 middle dose bid \[50 patients\] or placebo \[25 patients\]) and Group C (TF0023 low dose bid \[50 patients\] or placebo \[25 patients\]). The study design in Part B will be the same as used in Part A.~Each patient enrolled in either Group B or Group C will receive study treatment in a double blind manner for 16 weeks starting between 3 and 60 days after the onset of stroke symptoms (Day 1 of the study).~Patients will return to the study site at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 for efficacy and safety assessments. After the Week 16 assessments have been performed, patients will receive active treatment in an open-label manner starting the next day through the EOS at Week 32. That is, patients who were receiving active treatment during the double-blinded period will continue to receive active treatment, and patients who were receiving placebo will switch to active treatment for the remaining 16 weeks of the study. Patients will have a follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the Early Termination visit or the Week 32 (EOS) visit."

A randomized, open label design will be used in which one dose of IXT-m200 will be compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled in 4 cohorts. A dose escalation approach will be used so that progressively higher IXT-m200 doses will be evaluated in each cohort. In conjunction with safety monitoring, this design assures the opportunity to observe early safety findings before any participants are exposed to the next higher dose. The randomization ratio for IXT-m200 versus TAU is defined as 4:1 for each cohort so that the number of participants receiving TAU equals the number receiving each dose of IXT-m200 at the end of the study.~Agitation scales and vital signs will be recorded to track effect of the antibody treatment versus TAU over time on agitation associated with METH use. While in the emergency department (ED), detailed and pertinent medical and psychiatric histories, and physical exam will be obtained, along with laboratory assessments and ECGs. In the ED, participants will give blood samples for analysis of METH and IXT-m200 concentrations and followed for development of adverse events. Participants will be evaluated at 2 days and 4 weeks after discharge from the ED for adverse events and drug use history. Cohort escalation reviews will be performed by the Sponsor, Medical Monitor, and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) between cohorts and the next group will not start until after completion of this review.",

Common standard of care regimens use either a proteasome inhibitor (PI) or an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) in combination with dexamethasone with or without a monoclonal antibody (mAb) such as daratumumab. After relapse from PIs or IMiDs, patients are often retreated with drugs that have same mechanism of action to which they have been sensitive. The disease becomes refractory and all effective treatment options are exhausted. Daratumumab is a human IgG1 mAb that binds with high affinity to unique epitope on cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) and attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38. Study is to determine the efficacy of Dara-SC in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) in adult participants with relapsed refractory MM who had 1 to 3 prior line(s) of treatment including a line containing daratumumab to evaluate daratumumab retreatment. The MM treatment is determined on an individual basis where patient's age, prior therapy, bone marrow function, co-morbidities, patient preference and time to relapse are considered. Common standard of care regimens use either PI or an IMiD in combination with dexamethasone with or without a mAb. It is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: Screening (28 days), Treatment, and Follow-Up. Assessments like chest X-ray, spirometry test, electrocardiogram (ECG), will be performed during Screening phase. During the Treatment Phase, participants will be randomized to receive Kd or DKd. Efficacy assessments like bone marrow examination will be performed. Follow-up will continue until the end of study."

It is indeed recognized that reducing satisfaction from smoking before a quit attempt begins to undermine the learned association between smoking and reward and thus promotes the success of these attempts."

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase plays a major role in the de-novo pyrimidine synthesis and is specifically expressed at high levels in proliferating or activated lymphocytes. Resting lymphocytes satisfy their pyrimidine requirements through a DHODH-independent salvage pathway. Thus, IMU-838-mediated DHODH inhibition selectively affects activated, rapidly proliferating lymphocytes. The metabolic stress secondary to DHODH inhibition leads to a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine release including interleukin (IL)-17 (IL-17A and IL-17F) and interferon gamma (IFNγ), and to an increased apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.~This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in patients with moderate-to-severe UC with an option for open-label treatment extension. The study comprises a blinded induction phase to establish the optimal dose of IMU-838 to induce response and remission, a blinded maintenance phase to evaluate the potential of IMU-838 to maintain remission until Week 50, and an open-label treatment extension arm for all patients who discontinue the blinded phase as scheduled or prematurely, subject to certain restrictions. A subset of patients will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) period at the start of the open-label period to establish a full single-dose PK profile."
